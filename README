This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/).

Compilation and Installation:

In order to compile VTun you need several software packages.
Required packages: 
  - Good C compiler (gcc, egcs, etc)
  - Lexical Analyzer (flex, lex)
  - YACC (bison)
  - Universal TUN/TAP driver 	http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun
  - OpenSSL encryption library 	http://www.openssl.org
  - Rust and cargo

Optional packages:
  - SOCKS library:
	 Socks5 by NEC (recommended)	http://www.socks.nec.com 
	 Dante Socks4/5 	http://www.inet.no/dante 

To configure VTun run:
  aclocal
  autoconf
  ./configure 
Optional support:
  --disable-shaper  	compile without Traffic shaping support
  --enable-socks 	compile with SOCKS support

Configure automatically searches for all required library and header
files.  However you might need to specify location of the files which
could not be found in default location:
  SSL(Crypto) library:
  --with-ssl-lib=/path/to/library (libcrypto.a) 
  --with-ssl-headers=/path/to/headers (md5.h blowfish.h)

  LZO library:
  --with-lzo-lib=/path/to/library (liblzo.a) 
  --with-lzo-headers=/path/to/headers (lzo1x.h)

  SOCKS library:
  --with-socks-lib=/path/to/library (libsocks.a or libsocks5.a) 

To compile and install run:
  make install
Currently VTun-ng is a hybrid rust, C and bison setup, which
unfortunately means it can be a little bit painful to compile
and install. The rust part is contained in a shared object for
now, which enables the rust part to be independent of the C
part with regards to runtime dependencies.

Read manual page for 'vtunngd' and the config file example for
configuration and other suggestions.
