 - Experimental features that are planned to be launched with 3.1.0
   - dropcaps, setuid, setgid
   - bidirectional auth
 - Requires encryption "3.1" config, where 3.1 implies bidirectional auth
   This is supposed to be a client setting that requires the server to
   comply with required features.
 - Allowlist for encryption algorithms, client setting since the server
   decides which algorithm is used. But the client should reject the connection
   if the server chooses an algorithm not in the allowlist.
 - Add new crypto algorithms, specificly AES-GCM, AES-GCM-SIV which does integrity checking.
 - Add PKI-mode and assymetric key mode.
 - Build configurable enable/disable zlib and lzo

General plan is to remain completely backwards compatible with
vtun-3.0.4 for a while.
